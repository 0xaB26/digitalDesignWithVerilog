### DIGITAL DESIGN WITH VERILOG :
#### 1)-A brief overview about verilog : 
Verilog is a hardware description language used to model digital circuits.
Verilog supports three modelling styles that allow you to design different circuits with different philosophie(behavrioural, structural and dataflow).
Usa uses verilog and europe uses vhdl.
Verilog has similar C-syntax and Verilog is a concurrent language, different than a “procedural” language like C or Java(statements are executed in parallel).

#### 2)-Tools and Simulators : 
ModelSim and Quartus prime are used to test and verify and simulate hdl codes(they support systemVerilog, VHDL, systemC ...).
